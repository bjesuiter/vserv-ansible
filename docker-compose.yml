# run commands inside the ansible container with:
# docker-compose run ansible bash
#
# if you want to run an ansible command, replace bash with ansible
# (yes, two times ansible in a row, because the first parameter defines the service
#  which should be called as defined in docker-compose
#  and the second one defines the executable inside the service
# )
#
# example command:
# docker-compose run ansible ansible all -m ping -u you
